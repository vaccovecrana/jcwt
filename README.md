## jcwt

`jcwt` is a minimal implementation of the Continuous Wavelet transform.

It is a Java port of [ruby-cwt](https://github.com/nishi-takao/ruby-cwt).

It is available at [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:jcwt).

```
implementation("io.vacco.jcwt:jcwt:0.1.0")
```

Currently, only the Morlet wavelet is implemented.

PRs and improvements are welcome.
